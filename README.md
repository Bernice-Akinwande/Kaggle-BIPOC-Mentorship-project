# Titanic Data Analysis
In history, one of the most infamous shipwrecks is the sinking of the titanic. While there were some chances of passengers surviving, some of the passengers were more likely to survive than the others. This notebook carries out an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the titanic dataset that answers some questions on the kind of passengers that were likely to survive using the passengers data. This dataset gotten from kaggle, contains information of 891 Titanic passengers. Each row represents one person with 12 columns which describes different attributes about the passenger which includes whether they survived, the class they boarded on (Pclass), their names, sex, age, siblings and spouse that came aboard with them (SibSp), how many children and parents they came along with (Parch), their ticket numbers, the price they paid in pounds (Fare), their cabin numbers, and the port they embarked from.
